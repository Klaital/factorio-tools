Answers the question, "if I have so many of each of these processes running, what are my total inputs and outputs?"

Inputs:

 * Data files from recipelister mod
 * Config file listing the processes
 * The machine selected for each process
 * The quantity of machines running each process

Outputs:

 * Quantity of inputs into the system
 * Quantity of outputs from the system
 * TODO: power consumed 
 * Display values are rounded so that imprecise machine numbers don't matter.
